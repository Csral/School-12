# Manager

**Please note that using manager doesn't cause any O(perating)S(ystem) (or) Security troubles.**

### Superuser

Yes, we do take superuser permission in manager because it is needed to perform some elevated only tasks.

You may choose to set this manual or auto-run-as-su

## Auto run as su

Just a verification stage which validates permissions levels and self-elevates without user prompt [ except password or acceptance[windows] ].
